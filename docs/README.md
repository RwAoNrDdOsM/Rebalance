## Melee Weapons

### Kruber
#### 1H Sword (Kruber + Sienna)
+ Finesse multiplier (headshot/crit multiplier) increased to ~2 for all attacks, up from 1.4 for light attacks, 1.5 for heavies.

  + *While the change is simple, this will increase the horde damage of 1h sword to a point where it will feel like it performing its niche adequately. As an added bonus, the armor damage should feel somewhat better on headshot.*

#### 1H Mace / 1H Hammer
+ Light attacks 1 and 2 and push attack now have Tank hit mass multiplier.
+ Light attacks 3 & 4 now have the same single target damage profile.
+ Light attack 3 now has 10% bonus crit to compensate for being an uppercut animation.

  + *One handed hammer will remain largely unchained. It already had high stagger on light attacks, but against many targets it essentially did single target damage which could make it feel like a worse one-handed axe (it failed to cleave marauders or gors on Cataclysm). We’ve now increased its damage cleave and gave some more punch to light attack 3 while making it single target which lines up better with its animation.*

#### 2H Hammer (Kruber + Bardin)
+ The push attack now has the same damage profile as the heavy attacks. No tank hit mass count.
+ Heavy tank attacks now properly puts enemies into stagger level 2 (fixes a bug).

  + *By changing the push stab, we are attempting to make this weapon a little more forgiving on classes not named Slayer, giving it better horde control.*
  *Slayer already has the attack speed to get off heavy attacks reliably, and the push attack was mostly used as single target DPS. Push stab can now be used on other characters to make space to get off a heavy charge attack.*

#### 2H Sword (Kruber + Saltzpyre) 
+ Move speed charging heavy attacks increased to 60% from 20%
+ Light attack animation speed sped up by approximately 10% 

  + *In the first iteration of the mod, light attacks were inadvertently increased by 15%, making the weapon feel overtuned.*
  *The goal is to make light attacks useful so you aren’t always just spamming heavy attacks. Lights should be better against pure horde and heavy attacks should be better against mixed hordes due to being able to cleave armoured enemies and maulers (both of which require armour sliding properties) unlike light attacks.*

#### Mace + Shield/ Hammer + Shield
+ Heavy Chain now begins with shield bash

  + *Making the shield bash more accessible was needed to put it more in line with Axe + Shield and Sword + Shield.*

#### Mace + Sword
+ Lights 1 and 2 now have the same damage profile as 1H Mace.
+ Lights 3 and 4 now have the same damage profile as 1H Sword.
+ Each weapon in the heavy attack now has the same damage profile as the original Falchion Heavy.
+ Heavy attacks and light attacks 3 & 4 now have Linesman hit mass count.

  + *The goal here was to make the weapon actually feel like a mace and sword rather than 2 swords stuck together (the original damage profiles were too similar). Now the first 2 light attacks will provide control and stagger while the sword light attacks provide horde clear and damage cleave. This should allow you to push-stab heavy heavy for maximum horde dps.*
  *The change to heavy attacks make the slow, low range heavies now feel far more rewarding.*

#### Halberd
+ Heavy chain order reversed, the first heavy is now the Heavy Stab, and the second heavy is now the Heavy Sweep.
##### Intact Attack Chains:
+ Light chain and push-stab chain remains intact
+ Light 1 -> Light 2 -> Heavy stab, Lights -> Heavy stab chain intact
##### New Attack Chains:
+ Light sweep (L1) chains into Heavy sweep (H2) -> repeat
+ Heavy stab (H1) chains into light stab (L2) into light overhead (L3) -> repeat
+ Heavy stab (H1) chains into light stab (L2) -> repeat
+ Light sweep (L1) chains into Heavy sweep (H2) -> repeat
+ Heavy sweep (H2) chains into Light sweep (L2)
##### Weapon Changes:
+ Heavy Linesman added to Heavy Sweep (H2) *Armory mod will not reflect the change in heavy attack order*
+ Dodge range increased from 0.95(-5%) to 1.0 (0%)

  + *Halberd had a lot of complexity to it, hidden behind suboptimal weapon chaining, the idea with the animation swap of the heavies was to create some new attack combos that would be quite useful while retaining the useful orginial weapon chains. Should be quite an interesting buff, give it a try!*

### Bardin
#### 1H Axe (Bardin + Saltzpyre)
+ Animation pause after Light 3 reduced from 0.42s to 0.3s
+ Light attack animation speed increased by roughly 8%
+ Move speed while performing light attacks increased (from 75% to 85%) 
+ Heavy attack charge time reduced from 0.6s to 0.5s
+ Heavy attacks now share a damage profile with 2H Hammer light attacks

  + *One handed axe should be a high damage armor killing weapon that struggled somewhat with hordes. This was already the role of the weapon, but unfortunately, it did not perform that role adequately. These buffs should help it with its place relative to Axe and Falchion. Heavies were buffed to be a bit faster to keep them competitive with lights and similarly the damage profile change was mainly to put it significantly ahead of lights in super armor damage.*

#### 1H Mace / 1H Hammer
+ Light attacks 1 and 2 and push attack now have Tank hit mass multiplier.
+ Light attacks 3 & 4 now have the same single target damage profile.
+ Light attack 3 now has 10% bonus crit to compensate for being an uppercut animation.

  + *One handed hammer will remain largely unchained. It already had high stagger on light attacks, but against many targets it essentially did single target damage which could make it feel like a worse one-handed axe (it failed to cleave marauders or gors on Cataclysm). We’ve now increased its damage cleave and gave some more punch to light attack 3 while making it single target which lines up better with its animation.*

#### 2H Axe
+ Heavy attacks now have linesman hit mass count.
+ Light attack 3 now has the same damage profile as light attacks 1 and 2.
+ Push attack now has linesman.
+ Now has 6 stamina (3 shields), up from 5 stamina (2.5 shields).

  + *2H Axe has long been stuck as 2H Hammers' anemic little brother. Now, 2HH will still provide superior control and super armor damage.*
  *2H axe will be better damage against single target infantry damage and monster damage. The heavy attacks will have more horde clearing potential than 2HH at the cost of stagger and control.*

#### 2H Hammer (Kruber + Bardin)
+ The push attack now has the same damage profile as the heavy attacks. No tank hit mass count
+ Heavy tank attacks now properly puts enemies into stagger level 2 (fixes a bug) 

  + *By changing the push stab, we are attempting to make this weapon a little more forgiving on classes not named Slayer, giving it better horde control.*
  *Slayer already has the attack speed to get off heavy attacks reliably, and the push attack was mostly used as single target DPS. Push stab can now be used on other characters to make space to get off a heavy charge attack.*

#### Axe + Shield 
+ Light attacks sped up slightly
+ Charge time required for heavy attacks decreased slightly

  + *Attack chaining should feel a little bit smoother with the attack speed buff.*

#### Mace + Shield/ Hammer + Shield
+ Heavy Chain now begins with shield bash 

  + *Making the shield bash more accessible was needed to put it more in line with Axe + Shield and Sword + Shield.*

#### Dual Axes 
+ Finesses multiplier on all attacks increased to ~ 2.0 (up from ~1.5) 

  + *Dual axes will now have higher damage potential for the skilled dwarfs who can reach for the heads of rotbloods.*

#### Warpick
+ Linesman hit mass count added to light attacks 

  + *Warpick is the highest armour dps melee weapon in the game, limited by overkill damage and long charge times, but it has a niche. It retains that niche, but is now less punishing against hordes due to increased cleave and increased stagger cleave for its rather slow light attacks.*

### Kerillian
#### Elven 1H Sword
+ Light attack Finesse multiplier increased to ~2.0 from ~1.4
+ Heavy 2 changed to the damage profile of Crowbill Heavy 1
+ Light 3 armor damage increased by 20%   

  + *This weapon should be the highest armor dps of any 1H sword. It received a buff to light 3's armour damage to make it more useful in comparison to heavies. The change to heavy 2 will allow users to chain heavies for better armour damage.*
  *The horde clear of light attacks was increased via improved headshot damage to reward skillful play.*

#### Elven 2H Axe (Glaive)
+ Reverted WoM nerf. Linesman added back to light attacks 
+ Now has 6 stamina (3 stamina shields), previously 4 stamina (2 shields)

  + *2 stamina shields on the weapon was too punishing relative to its mobility, so it was buffed to 3 stamina shields. Reverting the nerf to linesman on light attacks helps it to be less overshadowed by Sword and Dagger in horde clear.*

#### Elven Axe
+ Heavy attacks now share a damage profile with 2H Hammer Light Attacks 
+ 20% bonus critical strike chance added to push stab

  + *The bonus crit was added to the push stab to make up for a lack of bonus crit on the other lights in comparison to 1h axe. This weapon compensated for the lack of crit chance on light attacks by having increased attack speed. However, this buff was partially negated by having reduced swift slaying uptime. The crit on push stab should alleviate this issue. Heavy attacks were also buffed to be more rewarding in comparison to light attacks. *

#### Elven Dual Daggers
+ Removed bonus 10% crit from lights 1 and 2

  + *Dual Daggers perform extremely well even against hordes for a single target weapon because of its excellent headshot/crit multiplier(finesse multiplier) on light attacks, its 10% critical chance reduces the necessity to land headshots, and is now removed from lights 1 and 2 to encourage headshotting (high finesse weapons should encourage around headshotting). Critical chance is left on lights 3 and 4 to compensate for the slower animation time of light 4.  *

#### Elven Dual Swords
+ Dual swords light attack damage increased by 25% against infantry. 
+ Push-stab armor damage increased by 20% 

  + *Dual swords are a horde clearing specialist weapon that was too heavily reliant on critical fishing on lights 3/4 for damage, and with extremely poor armour damage that limited its usefulness off Shade. The boost to infantry damage should help it better excel at its role, and the boost to the push stab was to help it have a better way to deal with armour that also increased the usefulness of its push-stab.*

#### Elven Greatsword 
+ Light attack animation speed increased ~10%

  + *This will make the weapon less dependent upon the push stab for horde damage. (push stab is about 30% faster than a light attack with +25% critical chance by default)*

#### Elven Spear
+ Push attack, Light 3, & Heavy 1 now all have Linesman hit mass count.
+ Reverted 25% nerf to light stabs that came with WoM, (base damage up to 0.25 from 0.2)

  + *The goal for the elven spear is to make it a high-skill high reward weapon. The weapon should be focused on landing headshots, but the nerf to its base damage in WoM and the removal of 50% headshot bonus talent on Waystalker made the light stabs and the weapon itself struggle, so the nerf to its base damage has been reverted to help it against armour and superarmor.*
  *At the same time, we wanted to make the various attack chains (push attack chain, entire light chain, heavy sweep opener light chain) have a place, so you are incentivized to not cancel out of light 3 in the light chain against hordes, so light 3 received linesman.*
  *Similarly, the push stab and the heavy 1 sweep received linesman to help them cleave.*

#### Elven Spear + Shield
+ Light 3 changed from a poke into a sweep, added linesman to light 3

  + *More of a consistency change with Elven spear, but does not change much about the weapon itself.*

### Saltzpyre
#### 1H Axe (Bardin + Saltzpyre)
+ Animation pause after Light 3 reduced from 0.42s to 0.3s
+ Light attack animation speed increased by roughly 8%
+ Move speed while performing light attacks increased (from 75% to 85%) 
+ Heavy attack charge time reduced from 0.6s to 0.5s
+ Heavy attacks now share a damage profile with 2H Hammer light attacks

  + *One handed axe should be a high damage armor killing weapon that struggled somewhat with hordes. This was already the role of the weapon, but unfortunately, it did not perform that role adequately. These buffs should help it with its place relative to Axe and Falchion. Heavies were buffed to be a bit faster to keep them competitive with lights and similarly the damage profile change was mainly to put it significantly ahead of lights in super armor damage.*

#### 2H Sword (Kruber + Saltzpyre) 
+ Move speed charging heavy attacks increased to 60% from 20%
+ Light attack animation speed sped up by approximately 10% 

  + *In the first iteration of the mod, light attacks were inadvertently increased by 15%, making the weapon feel overtuned.*
  *The goal is to make light attacks useful so you aren’t always just spamming heavy attacks. Lights should be better against pure horde and heavy attacks should be better against mixed hordes due to being able to cleave armoured enemies and maulers (both of which require armour sliding properties) unlike light attacks.*

#### Axe + Falchion
+ Removed heavy linesman and bonus 20% crit from push attack
+ Increased dodge count from 3 to 4
+ Increased dodge distance from 1.1(10%) to 1.2(20%) 

  + *Its mobility was the lowest of any dual weapon, while its components, the 1H axe and 1H falchion were not the least mobile 1H weapons, so its mobility(dodge count/range) was buffed slightly.*
  *Heavy linesman and +20% critical chance were a bit much for its push attack when it already has an excellent light attack chain.*

#### Falchion
+ Now has 6 stamina (3 stamina shields), previously 4 stamina (2 shields)
+ Heavy attacks 1 & 2 now have the same damage profile as Elf 1H Sword Heavy 1 
+ Light attack 3 now has the same damage profile as Heavy attacks 1 & 2 

  + *The goal for Falchion is be an "in-between" weapon compared to Kruber/Siennas' 1h sword and Kerillians' 1h sword. It will have better armor damage than Kruber/Siennas' 1h sword, but worse horde clear. Compared to Kerillians' 1h sword, it should have worse armour damage but better horde clear. Stamina was buffed because 2 stamina shields was way too punishing for a 1h sword analogue on Saltzpyre.*

#### Flail
+ Lights 1 & 2 now have Tank hit mass count 
+ Damage of Heavy attacks increased by 30%

  + *We wanted flail to keep its unique feel and its unique role as an anti-shield, high control weapon. In order to buff its control and damage slightly, we added tank hit mass count to the first lights. The change to the heavy attacks was to make the long charge up feel more rewarding. *

#### Billhook
+ Increased dodge distance to 1.15(15%) from 1.1(10%)
+ Decreased dodge count from 99 to 3

  + *Billhook is a two handed weapon, 99 dodges does not make a whole lot of sense. 3 dodges with 15% dodge distance puts it on par with elven spear.*

### Sienna
#### 1H Sword (Kruber + Sienna)
+ Finesse multiplier (headshot/crit multiplier) increased to ~2 for all attacks, up from 1.4 for light attacks, 1.5 for heavies.

  + *While the change is simple, this will increase the horde damage of 1h sword to a point where it will feel like it performing its niche adequately. As an added bonus, the armor damage should feel somewhat better on headshot.*

#### Dagger (Sienna)
+ Now has 6 dodge count instead of 3

  + *Weapon doesn't struggle with dodge count, but 6 dodges instead of 3 was more for consistency with dual daggers and the mobility a dagger should have.*

#### Mace (Sienna)
+ Max dodge count increased to 4 from 3
+ Heavy 1 now has the same damage profile as 2H Hammer Light attack (23% buff to damage)
+ Animation time of Heavy 1 sped up slightly 
+ Range of Heavy 1 increased slightly 
+ Damage of Heavies 2 & 3 increased by roughly 30% 
+ Range of Heavies 2 & 3 increased slightly 
+ Animation speed of Heavies 2 & 3 increased slightly 
+ Light attack 1 damage profile changed to Halberd L3 Damage profile (30% buff to infantry damage, 60% buff to armor damage)
+ Range of all light attacks increased slightly 
+ Animation speed of all light attacks increased slightly
+ Move speed during all light attacks increased to 80% from 60%

  + *Siennas' mace has long since been left behind ( at least since Back to Ubersreik). Our goal was to take a weapon with clunky and complex move sets and make it feel powerful and rewarding.*
  *Overall buffs to damage, attack speed, and range should make the weapon feel way better to play. Light attack 1->block cancel was buffed to be an excellent single target option, Heavy 1 similarly but excelling specifically for super armor.*

#### Flaming Flail
+ The explosion of Heavy 1 now deals direct explosion damage

  + *Heavy 1’s explosion is no longer an empty animation. This attack will now deal AOE damage as an explosion. Previously it applied a DOT only to the primary target, created an AOE stagger, and only visually set multiple enemies on fire.*
  *Oddly, its intended damage profile is a direct damage explosion and not a DOT as its animation of lighting enemies on fire would suggest.*

## Ranged Weapons

#### Beam Staff 
+ Overcharge generated by shotgun blast reduced significantly (~33%)
+ Weapon switching while charging the weapon is reduced from 0.2s to 0s (matching all other staves)
+ Weapon switch window after a shotgun blast reduced from 0.4s to 0.3s to match the 0.31s animation time of the shotgun blast.

  + *The weapon has a target limit of 10 (quite low relative to other staves) within its AOE cone, which can be quite punishing if you fight hordes dense enough to reach that target limit, overcharge was reduced with this target limit in mind.*
  + *QOL changes like instant weapon switching while charging are to help reduce the jank with the weapon, and similarly, the weapon switch after a shotgun blast is to prevent missed inputs (if you queue up a weapon switch and light attack immediately after a shotgun blast, you will hold down the left click beam before weapon switching, generate additional overcharge and blow up).*

#### Drakefire Pistols
+ Overheat of the shotgun blast reduced ~33%
+ Dodge range buffed from 85% (-15%) to 100% (0%)

  + *It has a similar target limit of 10, rationale for the reducing the overehat of the shotgun blast is the same.*

#### Empire Longbow
+ Forced zoom delay is now 2s instead of 0.4s (allows full charge without being forced to zoom in)
+ 25% move speed while holding a full charge (increased from 0% previously, 25% is similar to the full charge move speed of bolt staff)

  + *The forced zoom delay previously meant that you were forced to zoom in well before the arrow would finish a full charge, the full zoom is still there, but now you have much more time to shoot prior to being forced to zoom in. The move speed debuffs on Empire longbow did not make much sense previously, (quick shots by default have 50% move speed, partial charges have 100% move speed and full charge is 0% move speed.)*
  *These changes should make the weapon feel much smoother and less sickening for people that dislike forced zoom. Also, the slight move speed buff will allow you to re-position slightly when friendlies run in front of you while you’re charging a full charge.*

#### Handgun 
+ Reload time reduced from 2.0s to 1.5s
+ Max ammo = 16, up from 12
+ Cleave buffed 50% to match crossbow

  + *Changes were made to reload time, ammo count, and cleave to make them more competitive in elite killing and special killing relative to crossbow and repeater handgun*

#### Repeater Pistol 
+ Linesman is now on the bullet spray ( linesman on ranged weapons gives shotgun mass reduction) 
+ Additionally the bullet spray has been given 50% additional penetration against Chaos Warriors on crit (now deals 75% superarmor damage relative to armor damage on crit, previously 50%)

  + *Damage of the critical on bullet spray versus superarmor was boosted with the intention of being able to one shot chaos warriors on Bounty Hunter with max power and at least 50% of pellets hitting the head, previously you were 24% short in damage assuming max power and every pellet hitting the head.*
  *Linesman will help bullet spray cleave more like a shotgun, the pellets will have triple the cleave of a shotgun pellet, and deal more damage overall per pellet, making it a more impactful niche weapon.*
  *Changes keep it a very niche weapon for Bounty Hunter, intention was to avoid buffing it into a situation where it becomes too similar to Brace of Pistols*

#### Swiftbow
+ Increased armor damage by approximately 100% on charged shots
+ Increased monster damage by 30% on charged shots
+ Increased cleave by 100% for quick shots and 100% for charged shots

  + *Its specialized niche is killing hordes, the cleave was buffed to reflect that, and the improvements to monster damage and armour damage on the charged shots were mostly to help it kill specials in a reasonable manner.*

#### Throwing Axes
+ Increased monster and berserker damage by 30%

  + *Reload speed on these can be pretty crippling, made them more rewarding by buffing a few of their weak areas, the monster and berserker damage in particular are lacking.*

#### Volley Crossbow (Saltzpyre)
+ Ammo pool boosted by 50% (from 30 max ammo to 45)
+ Cleave increased by 150% to match crossbow
+ Reload time reduced from 5s to 4s
+ Dodge count increased to 3 from 1

  + *Volley Xbow is now a valid horde clear ranged weapon, primarly on BH, but it can be made to work on the other careers. The increased cleave allows it to actually cleave hordes, the reduction in reload time and dodge count makes it less punishing to reload during hordes, and the ammo pool was boosted so that you have the ammo to actually use it for horde clear and have the ammo to be able to shoot at specials.*

#### Volley Crossbow (Shade)
+ Cleave increased by 150% to match crossbow

  + *Damage profile was shared with Volley Crossbow on Saltzpyre, needed a buff anyway.*
