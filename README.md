# Rebalance Mod
*Mod required hostside and clientside. Damage calculation and weapon stats are clientside but damage profiles don't seem to update clientside.*

This mod buffs most underperforming weapons for Cataclysm and nerfs a few of the overperforming weapons. All of the changes have been playtested by a few people in developing it, but more feedback is needed.
